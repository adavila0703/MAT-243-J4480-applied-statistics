You can definitely see a plot which shows the trend of higher gas mileage with lower horsepower.

          mpg        wt        hp
mpg  1.000000 -0.889319 -0.767982
wt  -0.889319  1.000000  0.643511
hp  -0.767982  0.643511  1.000000

Regression equation:

y = 38.5474 - 4.4513 (wt) - 0.0299 (hp)

You would use this model to calculate a decrease of MPG for every unit of weight and horsepower. 4.4513 MPG for weight and 0.0299 MPG for horsepower.
