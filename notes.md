- A **quantitative variable** can take on a numeric value (quantitative data) that can be measured and ordered. Ex: A person's age, the outside temperature, and a meal's price are quantitative variables. Example numeric values are an age of or years, a temperature of or degrees, and a price of or dollars.

- A **categorical variable** can take on the value (usually a label) of one of several categories. Ex: A person's gender, seasons, and U.S. companies are categorical variables. Gender can be male or female, seasons can be fall, winter, spring, or summer, and U.S. companies can be Wal-Mart, McDonalds, UPS, etc. A categorical variable is often called a qualitative variable (known by qualities, rather than quantities).

- A **nominal variable**'s categories have no ordering, existing in name only, like apples, oranges, and grapes. ("Nominal" means "in name only").

- An **ordinal variable**'s categories have an ordering, like disagree, neutral, and agree.

- A **continuous variable**'s values are infinite along a continuum of values within a range, typically real numbers. Continuous variables usually represent measurements, like height ( meters) or temperature ( degrees).

- A **discrete variable**'s values are finite within a range, typically integers. Discrete variables usually represent countable items, like people in a family () or cars in a city (). Generally, if "number of" can be added to the beginning, the variable is discrete, like "number of people in a family", but not "number of height". Note: "Discrete" means separate or distinct, not to be confused with "discreet" which means careful or unobtrusive.
